    <!-- the style tag is used to define style information for an html document -->
    <!-- inside the style element, you can specify the CSS styles for different HTML elements on the page -->
    <!-- Each HTML document can contain multiple style tags, they wil be applied in the order placed in the html document -->
    <!-- style element can be placed in the body but it is better practice to lace it in the head -->
