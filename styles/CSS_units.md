# Css units

## Absolute units

- are units that are fixed, and a length expressed in any of these units will appear as the same size

- these units are used if the size of medium is known

- examples: cm, mm, in,pt(points),pc (pica) and px(pixels)

## Relative units

- are units that scale
- these lenght units are relative to the size of the screen or another property
- Preferred as they scale better when viewed on various screen sizes
- examples: %, em, rem, vw, and vh
- %, em, both depend on the size of the parent element
- rem = root em it does not inherit the font size of the parent element, but it takes it from the root element, which is the html element
- vh = view heigh, 1vh means 1% of view ports height
- vw= view width, 1vw means 1% of the view ports' width
